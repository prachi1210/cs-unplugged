# Storytelling

{image file-path="img/topics/unplugged-programming-icon.png" alt="Students standing around a large checkerboard grid." caption="This example is a starter lesson with an object in the middle. The girl on the white square is "The Bot", the girl at the back is "The Programmer" and the boy in the green and gold is the Tester."}

## Key questions

How could thinking about programming help us to retell stories?
Why is it important to get the sequence right when retelling a story?

## Lesson starter

Ideally this lesson should take place around a large grid such as:

-   An outside painted chess board.
-   Grids in your classroom carpet.
-   Making masking tape grids one the floor in your classroom.
-   Draw a chalk grid either in your classroom or outside.

Ask for two volunteers and give yourself and them the roles of:

**Role 1:** The Developer (who writes the program) -  The teacher will model this initially

**Role 2:** The Tester (who instructs the Bot and looks for bugs)

**Role 3:** The Bot (who runs the program)

We’re going to write our own program that retells the story we just read.
We read Little Red Riding Hood.
I’m going to mix up the story!

I’ve placed on my grid the main ideas from the story.
Let’s see what we have.

-   There’s a big bad wolf.
-   There’s Little Red Riding Hood
-   There’s Grandma’s house.
-   There’s also a well.

Once upon a time there was a misunderstood wolf, who everyone thought was unfriendly because he had big sharp scary teeth.
He was very shy and one day he heard a little girl skipping down the path and he needed to hide quickly, and the only place was to hide in the well.

{image file-path="img/topics/kidbots-little-red-riding-hood-alternative-story.png" alt="An 8 by 8 grid with the following objects in different squares: A well, Grandma's house, Little Red Riding Hood, and a wolf."}

Program the wolf to hide in the well, the wolf can move one square at a time.
The forward command moves them to the square they are facing, and turn left and turn right makes them turn 90 degrees on the square that they are standing on.
How would we write the instructions using our whiteboards to make these moves?

{panel type="teaching" title="Teaching observations"}

Ideas for this include using arrows; abbreviations (like F, L, and R), writing in a different language, using symbols from other cultures, and writing in Braille.
Start by programming one character to the end location.
Students may ask if they can program both Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf.
If they do that, have separate teams programming each character, or separate whiteboards for each character if the one team would like to try this.

{panel end}

## Lesson activities

1.  Work in groups of three, one person is the Bot, another is the Tester and last person is the Programmer.
2.  Agree on what will be written down on the whiteboard to be the programming language for move forward, move left, and move right.
3.  Find a toy and blocks from around the classroom.
4.  Together finish retelling the "Little Red Riding Hood" story and focus your programming on what one character will do so you can program them to move from one point to another point.
5.  The Programmer writes down on a whiteboard what the "program" is to get the toy to where it needs to go.
6.  The Tester then takes the whiteboard and a different coloured whiteboard pen.
    The Tester tells the Bot each instruction in the program.
    The Tester puts a tick next to the code that is correct and underlines any code that causes problems (such as running off the board or into an object, or running out of instructions before reaching the goal).
    If this happens the Tester says "Stop" and the Bot stops and goes back to the start.
    The Tester gives the whiteboard to the Programmer, who then debugs the code and gives the Tester a revised version.
    The "bug" might be earlier than where the Tester noted that things went wrong!

    {panel type="teaching" title="Teaching observations"}

    The Tester need not necessarily communicate using the words "Forward", "Left" and "Right".
    For example, the could use another language, including sign language, or use other gestures to communicate each action to the Bot.
    To write the program you could have cards with these written on so students don’t have to remember all the new learning.
    This is a great opportunity to use words from an unfamiliar language; there are only three words that will be used over and over (although you could also introduce phrases like "your turn", 'well done" and so on), so it is a good chance to learn by repetition of the new words.

    {panel end}

7.  Repeat step 6 until the program is free of bugs and works as intended.

8.  Change roles and move the Bot and the toy that needs rescuing until everyone has had a turn.

If you notice that your students need support to visualise how to write the instructions you could use a whiteboard pen to scaffold the instructions.

### Write your own story

Make up your own story using a toy and a block.
You could also put things in the way that the toy needs to avoid such as a pretend cave or a fierce animal.

{panel type="teaching" title="Teaching observations"}

Making up their own story provides integrated learning with creative writing, and then writing a program to focus on what one character will do.

## Applying what we have just learnt

It’s quite common to think that programming is some kind of special talent that people either have or don’t have, but this isn't so!
Like all skills, programming is something you learn through practise, making mistakes, and learning from them.
An important skill that programmers need is to be able to communicate with others, especially when they are working out what the program should do; they also need to be persistent when finding and fixing bugs.
Bugs happen all the time in programming, so being able to identify where the bug occurs and problem solving how to fix it is incredibly important.
It doesn’t matter how experienced you are at programming, there will always be bugs that need to be found, and fixed.
That’s why the word “debugging” is so important to programmers.

### Storytelling programming challenges

Simple robotic toys like the "Bee-Bot" have a very similar set of commands, and can be used to follow up.

## Lesson reflection

Now that you have experienced being a programmer, what did you think was the most challenging part of being a programmer?
Do you think this is a way you could plan out your story writing?
